# RoboFriends-React-CodeAlong
A searchable directory with Robot avatars, using React.js and a couple APIs.

This project is a code-along from one of Andrei Neagoie's courses, in which it serves as a hands-on introduction to working with React.js. As you'd expect, it also uses skills encountered earlier in the same course, such as fetch requests with APIs. The gradient background was produced with a simple 'app' made earlier in the course, too.

One of the APIs makes Robot avatars, and the other produces placeholder data for "users". The latter is where the names and contact information come from on the cards.

Andrei also used this section of the course to go over refactoring code and updating versions, putting things on GitHub, and deploying to the web. It's a nice "warm-up" for the main project of the course.
